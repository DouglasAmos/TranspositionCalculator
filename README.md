# TranspositionCalculator

Very often, musicians have to transpose their music into something that is not what is written.  While I usually enchorage my students to develop an independent fluency for transposition, I wanted to test myself and make a program that will produce the correct note with the input of a starting note and a direction and amount ot transposition.  That is the first step in my transposition method.  Transposition by interval however, is an inefficient and amateurish way to transpose.  Masterful transposers including brass players, composers, and especially conductors, use a method of transposition that involves clefs and revisualizing the entire key.  After my initial transposition by interval calculator, I am going to make a second version that tells the user what clef and what key visualization to use when given either a desired interval of transposition or a desired key goal for transposition.
